<h1>Do you have any idea how much you mean to me?!</h1>
<p>
	Yes, it is true that we were not so close in the beginning of our college life. But now?!
</p>
<p>
	I know what i'm gonna write ahead will be lil bit of cheezy-beezy, but for god's sake, you have to bare with me, pls?:) 
</p>
<p>How did you just pierce into my life so easily? I never thought i'll get attached to anyone like it happenned with you.
</p>
<p>
You managed and helped me to get out through the bad days of my life.You just made my life upside down idiot!
</p>
<p>
	Girl, you really have made a tremendous impact on my life. I have no other way but to just say this cheesy cliche dialogue that "what would i've done if you were not there in my life?"
</p>
<p>
You were there with me in all my ups and downs. You just stood by me when no one else did. I couldn't be more grateful for every lil thing you've done to make me happy!
Do you remember those days how we used to argue and fight for small things?! Those days we fight for no reason and ends up in tears?! God! those were one hell of some hectic days which i dont wanna get repeated ever in my life. 
Sorry for whatever i did till date which made you cry. I dont wanna loose you no matter what. Just stay close to me, pls :)
</p>
<p>
Love,
</p>
<p>
Athus!
